# 00_Scripts_General

 This is a general collection of Scripts I've written for file manipulation, data analysis, and bioinformatics purposes. Scripts that generate plots typically have an _plot(s)_ in the file name.


 Scripts are written for python versions 3.6+  
 Usage instructions can be obtained by typing python scriptname.py -h
